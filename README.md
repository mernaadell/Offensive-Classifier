#INTRO
    • Social media is a very popular way for people to express their opinions publicly and to interact with others online. In aggregation, social media can provide a reﬂection of public sentiment on various events. Unfortunately, many users engaging online, either on social media, forums or blogs, will often have the risk of being targeted or harassed via abusive language, which may severely impact their online experience and the community in general. The existence of social networking services creates the need for detecting user-generated hateful messages prior to publication. All published text that is used to express hatred towards some particular group with the intention to humiliate its members is considered a hateful message.
    
#PROBLEM STATEMENT
   • Twitter has more or less than 310 million monthly active users with total 500 million of tweets per day. Tweet is a 140-characters message that can contain opinion or information; tweets are not properly structured because users do not care about spelling and grammatical construction when posting their tweets.
